#### The focus on this lite container is on what analysts use most of the time for static analysis.
The solution wasn’t Rosetta, emulation, or hacks—it was to use the Python implementation, which works cleanly on ARM and is often sufficient for triage.

# REMnux-lite container
The Shift: From “REMnux-in-a-Container” to “REMnux-Style Containers”

Rather than install REMnux wholesale, I focused on what analysts actually use most of the time:

* Static analysis
* File format inspection
* String extraction
* YARA scanning
* Crypto and obfuscation analysis
* Network artifact parsing

This led to a REMnux-lite container—built intentionally, not dogmatically.

## What went in

#### Python-based tooling (ARM-safe, reproducible):

* pefile
* oletools
* flare-floss (Python version, not the x86 binary)
* yara-python
* capstone
* vivisect

#### Core system tools:
* file
* tshark
* tcpdump
* p7zip
* jq

#### What stayed out
* GUI tooling
* Kernel-dependent features
* x86-only binaries (unless explicitly emulated)

This wasn’t a compromise—it was a design decision.

## Why Containers Still Matter (Even When VMs Are Better)

A container will never fully replace a REMnux VM. And it shouldn’t.

But containers excel at things VMs are bad at:

* Deterministic builds
* Fast teardown
* Parallel analysis
* Automation
* Safe, read-only execution contexts

#### In my setup:

Containers handle:
* Sample ingestion
* Static triage
* YARA scanning
* Metadata extraction

VMs handle:
* Deep reverse engineering
* Debugging
* Detonation
* x86-only tooling

## Security Posture: Containers Are Not a Sandbox by Default

A container is not automatically safe.

My analysis containers run with:
* --read-only filesystem
* All Linux capabilities dropped
* No new privileges
* Explicit resource limits
* Controlled networking
* Read-only sample mounts

If you’re going to analyze malware in containers, you need to treat them as controlled execution environments, not magic boxes.

## Install and configure PODMAN Desktop

### Step 1:

mkdir -p ~/malware-lab


#### Set RAM and CPUs for podman machine:

	podman machine set --memory 8192 --cpus 4

#### Start default machine:

	podman machine start

#### Verify Podman is working:

	podman info

	and quick test:

	podman run --rm ubuntu echo "Podman OK"


### Step 2: Create a REMnux-style Container Image

	mkdir remnux-container;cd remnux-container

### Step 3: Create the Containerfile (already created Dockerfile)


### Step 4: Build the Image

	podman build -t localhost/remnux-lite:arm64 .

### Step 5: Run it safely

```bash
podman run -it --rm \
  --read-only \
  --cap-drop=ALL \
  --security-opt=no-new-privileges \
  -v ~/malware-lab:/analysis:Z \
  remnux-lite:arm64
```

### Optional: For stricter controls and hardening you can use:

```baseh
podman run -it --rm \
  --read-only \
  --cap-drop=ALL \
  --security-opt=no-new-privileges \
  --pids-limit=256 \
  --memory=2g \
  --network=slirp4netns \
  -v ~/malware-lab:/analysis:ro,Z \
  localhost/remnux-lite:arm64
```

#### This will create a read-only filesystem along with:

* All Linux capabilities dropped
* No new privileges
* Explicit resource limits
* Controlled networking
* Read-only sample mounts

> The container is executed with a read-only root filesystem. Only the `/analysis` directory is writable and intentionally exposed for controlled malware examination.

> Files placed in the host directory become immediately available inside the container for analysis.
